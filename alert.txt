While most of our libraries are open, we have recently experienced some temporary catalog and other service outages due to a cybersecurity incident. We are working to resolve the issues, and public WiFi and our main check-out services are available at all branches. Highlands Ranch library will remain closed through January 26 due to a water main break.
